# StegoChatX
A real-time platform for enhanced privacy and security in corporate messaging.

Our goal here is to create a secure yet simple communication system using the power of AES enhanced with ECC key exchange and user authentication and steganography.
In this system, when commmunication is going in between two users, the messages will be ecjcrypted using the AES and the keys will be exchanged using ECC which will also verify or authenticate the user i.e the client.

This encryoted message will now be compressed and integrated in an image which will be stored in the database and thus the actual transaction of the communication will be hidden.
